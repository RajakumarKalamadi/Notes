Object Orientred Programming language

In software engineering anythig that we have can be mapped to blueprint or vision. For example, in Amazon, every product has similar struture, we can generalise this make sure we don't repeat anything again and again

"Classes"

Classes are blueprint on a set of real life entities.
Classes are going to represent how an entity should look and behave. When I say how do they look, I refer to the properties they posses. And when I say how they behave then I mean what actions can be performed on them.

Let's Take an example:
Consider a product class, inside this product class what do you think should be the properties of a product? What is a Property ? Propertry is just any feauture that the product can contain.
> Name -> Name of the product
> Price -> price of the product
> Company -> Company of the product belongs to


Object 

Using classes the fonal entity that will develop is called as a object.



"This keyword of JS"

> this in JS works very differently then other language.
> this is a keyword is available to be acessed in any function or even outside any function and in classes as well.
> if we can use this keyword anywhere, then what is the value stored inside this ?

IN MOST OF THE CASES THID REFERS TO CALL SITE.

  Ahhh! What is a call site ?

Call site can be an object, or a position or may be even the new keyword. it refers to the entity which is calling this keyword.

"Exception"
It has an exception, this keyword will not refer to the call site if used inside an arrow function.
